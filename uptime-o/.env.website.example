# DOCKER VOLUME MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS
# ==========================================
# To use custom images (logo/favicon):
# 1. Create a directory with your custom images:
#    mkdir -p ./custom-images
#    cp your-logo.png ./custom-images/logo.png
#    cp your-favicon.ico ./custom-images/favicon.ico
#
# 2. Add volume mapping in docker-compose.yml:
#    volumes:
#      - ./custom-images:/app/content/images
#
# 3. Set environment variables to point to mounted files:
#    WEBSITE_LOGOPATH=/content/images/logo.png
#    WEBSITE_FAVICONPATH=/content/images/favicon.ico
